** Ext.ux.form.field.InputRadio ** -
 
It is a subclass of standard extjs4 radio class with the extension that it has a inputbox next to the boxLabel 
where the user can type the value that is to be its submit value and thus it disregards the 'inputValue' config supplied for 
standard radio button. 
Thus can be used in a  radiogroup along with normal radio buttons(static values) to have an option of a dynamic(user entered) value
 as a possible value.
